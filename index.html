      <p>I grew up in a very tech focused family, always trying to get the next upgraded device. Many in my family went into computer focused careers like IT and web development so I was exposed to it early on. The idea of working in the tech industry is something that has always fascinated me, and terrified me a little.</p>

      <p>I have always enjoyed learning new things and being met with new challenges. Being forced to find a solution and the thrill of it coming together. I also have a love for tech so its a no brainer combination right?</p>

      <p>But i resisted at first, mostly coming from a place of fear of how technical and fast paced everything would be. So i started reseaarching and really enjoying it so I bit the bullet and joined the web development bootcamp. It may be as tough as I thought it would be but it's also very rewarding.</p>
